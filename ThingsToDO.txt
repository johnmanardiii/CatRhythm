- Get notes moving past the time they are supposed to be hit.
3. Get accuracy detection and score
4. (VERY IMPORTANT)(VERY ANNOYING)Fix pausing bug that causes time to elapse for objects but not AudioSettings as the game runs.
5. Particle effects for notes that are hit/failed.
6. Fix the beat map as the first few notes are slightly out of time. (Might be script bug, but probably not)
